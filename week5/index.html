    <h1>Week 5 - Notes</h1>
    <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <h3>Types of Errors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices
        with which the program is interacting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty
        logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
      </li>
      <li>
        User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is
        unable to handle.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Exceptions</h4>
    <p>
      An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be
      used by the program to deal with the error.
    </p>
    <h4>Stack Traces</h4>
    <p>
      An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of
      functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.
      It’s often not just a single function or method call that causes an error.
    </p>
    <h4>Warnings</h4>
    <p>
      A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to
      cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run
      after a warning.
    </p>
    <h4>Strict Mode</h4>
    <p>
      ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and
      warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. This is due to
      the fact that strict mode considers coding practices that were previously
      accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.
    </p>
    <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
    <p>
      When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message.
      This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Try - If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can
        wrap it in a try block.
      </li>
      <li>
        Catch - This will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an
        exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a
        catch block.
      </li>
      <li>Finally - A finally block can be added after a catch block.</li>
    </ul>
