    <h1>Week 3 - Objects, DOM and Events</h1>
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <div>
      Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
      <br />
      When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that is called
      object-oriented programming, in short: “OOP”.
      <br />
      It is common that an object method needs to access the information stored
      in the object to do its job. For instance, the code inside user.sayHi()
      may need the name of the user.
      <br />
      To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.
      <br />
      Arrow functions are special: they do not have their “own” this. When this
      is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.
    </div>

    <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
    <div>
      Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that
      involves separating the code into objects that have properties and
      methods.
      <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
      <div>
        Encapsulation involves keeping all the programming logic inside an
        object and making methods available to implement the functionality,
        without the outside world needing to know how it is done.
      </div>
      <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
      <div>
        Various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to
        override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
      </div>
      <h3>Inheritance</h3>
      <div>
        In OOP, inheritance means we can take an object that already exists and
        inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its
        functionality by adding new properties and methods.
      </div>
    </div>

    <script>
      //Task 1 - Using "this" in object literal

      //   function makeUser() {
      //     return {
      //       name: "John",
      //       ref: this,
      //     };
      //   }

      //   let user = makeUser();

      //   alert(user.ref.name); // What's the result?

      //Task 2 - Create a calculator

      //   let calculator = {
      //     sum() {
      //       return this.a + this.b;
      //     },

      //     mul() {
      //       return this.a * this.b;
      //     },

      //     read() {
      //       this.a = +prompt("a?", 0);
      //       this.b = +prompt("b?", 0);
      //     },
      //   };

      //   calculator.read();
      //   alert(calculator.sum());
      //   alert(calculator.mul());
