    <h2>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    <p>
      The CSS3 transform property lets us translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew
      any element on the page. We can manipulate an elements appearance using
      transform functions. The value of the transform property is one or more
      transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be applied in the
      order theyâ€™re provided.
    </p>
    <h3>Translation</h3>
    <p>
      Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down.
      These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when
      declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right
      along the x and y axes. When you employ a translation function, you are
      moving elements without impacting the flow of the document. Unlike
      position: relative, which allows you to position an element either against
      its current position or against a parent or other ancestor, a translated
      element can only be moved relative to its current position. The
      translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the
      top.
    </p>
    <h3>Scaling</h3>
    <p>
      The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors
      horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be
      used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or
      pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. As with
      translate, you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. These
      functions will scale only the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical
      dimensions respectively.
    </p>
    <h3>Rotation</h3>
    <p>
      The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a
      specified angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is
      the elements center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with
      positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise. In
      addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns,
      but we will just be sticking with degrees.
    </p>
    <h3>Skew</h3>
    <p>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.</p>
    <h2>Transitions</h2>
    <p>
      Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time,
      essentially providing simple animations. For example, if a link changes
      color on hover, you can have it gradually fade from one color to the other
      instead of a sudden change. They are both transitions, but with the CSS
      transition property the color transition can be gradual. If the browser
      lacks support for transitions, the change will be immediate instead of
      gradual, which is fine and accessible.
    </p>
    <h2>Animations</h2>
    <p>
      Transitions animate elements over time; however, they are limited in what
      they can do. You can define starting and ending states, but there is no
      fine-grained control over any intermediate states. CSS animations, unlike
      transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.
    </p>
