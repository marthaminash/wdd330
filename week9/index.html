    <h2>The Browser Object Model</h2>
    <p>
      The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties
      and methods that contain information about the browser and computer
      screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view a
      page (though, this method is unreliable). We can also find out the
      dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been
      visited before the current page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and
      open dialogs that halt the execution of the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window.navigator object gives information about the users browser and
      operating system, although it can be unreliable. The window.location
      object provides information about the URL of the current page. The
      window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been
      visited in the session.
    </p>
    <p>
      he window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set
      amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method. The
      window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function.
      It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method. The
      window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and
      optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics
      capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.
    </p>
    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
    <p>
      HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It
      covers a variety of technologies, including several APIs that are
      accessible using JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access
      to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics
      card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give
      developers access, and control new features that appear in the latest
      devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the users
      device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage
      restrictions. The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic
      coordinates of the users device, as long as the user gives permission.
