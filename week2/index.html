    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Variables</h3>
      let and const vs. var <br />
      The main difference was that variables declared using let and const have
      block scope, which is discussed in more detail below. They also prevent
      from overwriting any built-in methods by assignment.
      <br />
      var variables have function scope.
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      Arrays are an ordered list of values. Arrays can be multidimensional -
      they contain other arrays.
      <br />We can use an if and else statement to control the flow of code
      <br />The switch statement can be used instead of multiple if and else
      statements <br />A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat
      a block of code while a condition is still true <br />A for loop works in
      a similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax <br />A for-of
      loop can be used to iterate over an array <br />Sets and maps are
      enumerable, so can also be looped over using a for-of loop
    </div>

      <h4>Functions</h4>
      Functions are first-class objects that behave the same way as other
      values.
      <br />Function declaration, function expression and assigning an anonymous
      function to a variable.<br />An argument is a value that is provided to a
      function when it is invoked. <br />The rest operator can be used to access
      multiple arguments as an array. <br />Default arguments can be supplied to
      a function by assigning them to the parameters. <br />Function
      declarations can be invoked before they are defined because they are
      hoisted to the top of the scope, but function expressions cannot be
      invoked until after they are defined. <br />A callback is a function that
      is provided as an argument to another function.
