    <h1>Week 10 - Notes</h1>
    <h2>Client-side form validation</h2>
    <p>
      Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all
      required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is
      called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted
      matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of
      good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the
      user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then
      rejected, a noticeable delay is caused by a round trip to the server and
      then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.
    </p>
    <h2>Different types of client-side validation</h2>
    <h3>Built-in</h3>
    <p>
      Built-in form validation uses HTML form validation features, which we've
      discussed in many places throughout this module. This validation generally
      doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better
      performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript
      validation.
    </p>
    <h4>Using built-in form validation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before
        the form can be submitted
      </li>
      <li>
        minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of
        textual data (strings).
      </li>
      <li>
        min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input
        types.
      </li>
      <li>
        type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address,
        or some other specific preset type.
      </li>
      <li>
        pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the
        entered data needs to follow.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is
      completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).
    </p>
    <h2>Using the Fetch API</h2>
    <p>
      The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and
      manipulating parts of the protocol, such as requests and responses. It
      also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way
      to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in the following
      significant ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Promise returned from fetch() won't reject on HTTP error status even
        if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, as soon as the server
        responds with headers, the Promise will resolve normally, and it will
        only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from
        completing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unless fetch() is called with the credentials option set to include,
        fetch():
        <ul>
          <li>won't send cookies in cross-origin requests</li>
          <li>won't set any cookies sent back in cross-origin responses</li>
          <li>
            As of August 2018, the default credentials policy changed to
            same-origin. Firefox was also modified in version 61.0b13)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
