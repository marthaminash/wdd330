    <h1>Week 4 - Notes</h1>
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <div>To create a form in HTML, we use the < form > element</div>
    <div> Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information. <br/>
    document.forms returns an HTML collection of all the forms on a page. <br/>
    form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.<br/>
    The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.

    <h2>Modular JavaScript</h2>
    <div>JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve. <br/>
    jQuery and Lodash are two popular libraries that provide a large number of useful and well-tested functions. </br>
    npm and yarn are package managers that can be used to install JavaScript packages.
    <h3>What is a module?</h3><br/>
    A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules. <br/>
    ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file.
    <br/>
    JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files. This makes it easier to maintain the code-base. JavaScript modules rely on the import and export statements.


    <br/>
    React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.
